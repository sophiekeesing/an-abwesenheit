# 🚨 Email Issue Explained & Solutions

## ❌ **Why Emails Aren't Sending**

The current setup has a **technical limitation**:

**Nodemailer (the email library) only works in Node.js backend servers, NOT in browser frontends like your Vue.js app.**

## 🔍 **What's Currently Happening**

When you try to invite a student, the system:

1. ✅ Creates the invitation token correctly
2. ✅ Shows "Email sent successfully" message
3. ✅ Logs the email content to browser console
4. ❌ **But doesn't actually send the email**

## 🎯 **Current Status**

Your Gmail credentials are **correctly configured**:

- ✅ Gmail Account: `itech.school.attendance@gmail.com`
- ✅ App Password: `vvdmqiqdwkvypbzm` (16 characters)
- ✅ From Email: `itech.school.attendance@gmail.com`
- ✅ School Name: `Berufsschule ITECH`

## 📋 **To See What Would Be Sent**

1. Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Try inviting a student
4. You'll see the complete email details printed

## 🛠️ **Solutions (Choose One)**

### **Option 1: Simple Backend (Recommended)**

Create a small Express.js server using the `email-setup-free.js` file:

```bash
# In a new terminal
mkdir email-server
cd email-server
npm init -y
npm install express nodemailer cors dotenv
# Copy code from email-setup-free.js
node server.js
```

### **Option 2: EmailJS (Browser-Based)**

1. Sign up at **emailjs.com** (free tier: 200 emails/month)
2. Connect your Gmail account
3. Use their browser SDK to send emails directly

### **Option 3: Netlify/Vercel Functions**

Use serverless functions to handle email sending

## 🔧 **Quick Test**

To see the email simulation:

1. Start your app: `npm run dev`
2. Go to Teacher Dashboard
3. Add a student with any email
4. Check the browser console - you'll see exactly what would be sent!

## 💡 **Next Steps**

The easiest solution is **Option 1** - I can help you set up a simple backend server that will actually send the emails using your existing Gmail credentials.
